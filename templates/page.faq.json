It is made from a softer and moreflexible thermoplastic elastomer material, which provides a more comfortable feel underfoot. The TPE series also comes with a non-slip finish that preventsslipping and sliding, making it a great option for everyday use.<\/p><p>Ultimately, your choice of floor liner material will depend on your personal preferences, your budget, and how you plan to use your vehicle.
