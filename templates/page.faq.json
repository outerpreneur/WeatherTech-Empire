It is made from a proprietary blend of thermoplastic elastomersthat offer superior strength and wear resistance. The HP series also has arigid core that provides additional support and stability to the liner, makingit perfect for heavy-duty use.<\/p><p>On the other hand, if you are looking for a more affordable and comfortable option, the TPE series is a great choice. It is made from a softer and moreflexible thermoplastic elastomer material, which provides a more comfortable feel underfoot. The TPE series also comes with a non-slip finish that preventsslipping and sliding, making it a great option for everyday use.<\/p><p>Ultimately, your choice of floor liner material will depend on your personal preferences, your budget, and how you plan to use your vehicle. If youfrequently transport heavy cargo or have pets that ride in your vehicle, the HPseries might be the better option. But if you're mainly using your vehicle forcommuting and running errands, the TPE series might be the more practical choice.<\/p>"
