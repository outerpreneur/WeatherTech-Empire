However, there are some differences between the two.<\/p><p>Here are some key differences between WeatherTech HP and TPE floor liners:<\/p><ol><li>Material: The WeatherTech HP liners are made from a proprietary blend of thermoplastic elastomers, while the TPE liners are made entirely of thermoplastic elastomers.<\/li><li>Texture: WeatherTech HP liners have a smooth surface with a raised outer lip to contain spills and debris, while TPE liners have a textured surface for added grip and a lower outer lip.<\/li><li>Price: WeatherTech HP liners are typically more expensive than TPE liners.<\/li><li>Fit: Both liners are custom-fit for specific makes and models of vehicles, but some users have reported that the WeatherTech HP liners have a more precise fit.<\/li><li>Warranty: Both liners come with a limited lifetime warranty, but the terms and conditions may vary.<\/li><\/ol><p>Ultimately, the choice between WeatherTech HP and TPE floor liners depends on your personal preferences and needs. If you want a smooth and precise fit with a raised outer lip for maximum spill and debris containment, WeatherTech HP liners may be the better choice. However, if you prefer a more textured surface for added grip and a lower outer lip, TPE liners may be a better option.<\/p>"
